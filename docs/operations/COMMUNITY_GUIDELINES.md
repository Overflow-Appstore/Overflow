# Overflow Community Guidelines

Overflow exists to tell authentic stories and connect support to people doing good work. To keep the community safe:

1. **Be respectful**. Celebrate impact without harassing or shaming others.
2. **Share truthfully**. Posts must represent real people, places, and needs.
3. **Protect privacy**. Do not share sensitive personal data without consent.
4. **Stay safe**. No hate speech, violence promotion, or exploitation of vulnerable populations.
5. **Use donations responsibly**. Funds must support the stated project or need.
6. **Moderation**. Overflow may remove content or suspend accounts that violate these guidelines.
7. **Reporting**. Use in-app tools to report abuse, fraud, or safety issues. Staff will review within 24 hours.
